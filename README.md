## Getting Started

If you're new to VAPT, here are some steps to get started:

1. **Understand the Basics**: Familiarize yourself with the concepts of vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.
2. **Learn Tools and Techniques**: Explore various tools and techniques used in VAPT, such as vulnerability scanners, exploit frameworks, and network sniffers.
3. **Practice in a Controlled Environment**: Set up a lab environment to practice VAPT techniques safely without causing harm to production systems.
4. **Stay Updated**: Keep up with the latest security trends, vulnerabilities, and mitigation techniques.

## Tools

This section lists some popular tools used in VAPT:

- [Nmap](https://nmap.org/): Network exploration tool and security scanner.
- [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/): Penetration testing framework.
- [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp): Web vulnerability scanner and proxy.
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/): Network protocol analyzer.
- [OpenVAS](https://www.openvas.org/): Open Vulnerability Assessment System.

## Best Practices

Here are some best practices to follow during VAPT activities:

- Conduct thorough reconnaissance before launching tests.
- Obtain proper authorization before testing.
- Document findings and vulnerabilities discovered.
- Report vulnerabilities responsibly and securely.
- Continuously update and patch systems to address vulnerabilities.
